## üéÆ Usage

### Traditional Try-On
1. Go to Home ‚Üí Select clothing item
2. Choose "IMAGE TEST" or "LIVE TEST"
3. Upload image or capture from camera
4. View the virtual try-on result

### AR Try-On
1. Click "AR Try-On" from navigation or trial room
2. Allow camera permissions
3. Click "Start AR" to begin
4. Select clothing from the bottom gallery
5. See real-time AR overlay
6. Capture photos with "Capture" button

### 3D Try-On
1. Click "3D Try-On" from navigation
2. Allow camera permissions if using body tracking
3. Select avatar model (default/male/female/custom)
4. Choose clothing from gallery
5. Use controls to adjust lighting, rotation, etc.
6. Capture screenshots of 3D try-on

## üîß Configuration

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Camera not working:**
- Check browser permissions
- Ensure camera is not used by other applications
- Try refreshing the page

**AR/3D features not loading:**
- Check browser WebGL support
- Update browser to latest version
- Disable browser extensions that might interfere

**Poor try-on quality:**
- Ensure good lighting
- Stand against plain background
- Keep full body in frame
- Use high-resolution images

**Model files missing:**
- Download required model files
- Place them in project root directory
- Check file permissions

### Performance Optimization

**For better performance:**
- Close unnecessary browser tabs
- Use Chrome or Firefox for best WebGL support
- Enable hardware acceleration in browser
- Use dedicated GPU if available

**For mobile devices:**
- Reduce camera resolution in code
- Disable shadows in 3D mode
- Use simplified avatar models
